								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.qualiformrubbermolding.com/Rubber-Parts.php">Rubber seal products</a>, rubber parts and gaskets are vital for preventing seepage of moisture or air.

The team will be there every step of the manufacturing process to make sure you have a high quality product that does the job right.</p>
<p>Qualiform knows that there are two separate stages in the life of a gasket or seal – the primary fit and function, and its ability to endure the environment to which it is exposed. Consider factors like:</p>
<ul class="betweenlist">
<li>Flammability: UL specifications, heat resistance</li>
<li>Function: the motion acting upon it</li>
<li>Temperature extremes: heat, cold</li>
<li>Weather: water, ozone, sunlight</li>
<li>Impermeability: exposure to gases</li>
<li>Organic materials: fungus resistance, odor, tastelessness</li>
</ul>
