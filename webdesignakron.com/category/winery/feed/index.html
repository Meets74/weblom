<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.mcellars.com/">M Cellars</a> is a boutique winery that has a spacious and warm and cozy atmosphere and including wine of course. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winery has a two-tiered deck and patio overlooking the vineyards to enjoy on warm Spring, Summer and Fall evenings. When</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> visiting during winter be sure to savor the experience in the cozy tasting room which has a wood-burning fireplace.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">M Cellars has so much to offer from wine clubs, and wine tastings, and acoustic nights on the patio. Along with Cellar tours and, Tank and Barrel Tastings are available by reservation. You can enjoy wine by the glass or bottle and light appetizers. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story behind the scenes of M Cellars Winery</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt &amp; Tara Meineke spent abounding weekends touring winery’s and caught the “wine-bug” and concluded that world-class wine should be grown and produced in their backyard. In 2007 they purchased the winery property and watched as their vision begins to unfold. The couple believed that they could produce a world-class wine despite the brutal Winter months of Northeast Ohio.  This is where the M Cellars arrives at, producing estate-grown cool climate wines. The vineyards spaced over 1000 vines per acre and M Cellars implements the VSP system which allows efficient control of crop size per plant.  The focus is the quality in the vineyards is expressed in every bottle of wine M Cellars produces. </span></p>
