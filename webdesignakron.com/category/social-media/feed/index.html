								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>What Is SEO?</h1>
<p><a href="https://site.bz/seo-company/what-is-seo/">What is SEO</a>? In today&#8217;s world of technology, it amazes me how many people actually do not know or understand exactly what is SEO and what it&#8217;s used for. SEO is an acronym that stands for Search Engine Optimization. Wikipedia defines SEO as a process that will increase the quality and quantity of your website traffic by increasing the visibility of your website or a web page to users of a web search engine. SEO refers to the improvement of unpaid results and excludes direct traffic/visitors and the purchase of paid placement. Still baffled? Let&#8217;s break it down even more.</p>
<p>SEO is basically a scorekeeper between you and your competitor business. The more information and activity Google notices from your website/page the more points you get and the higher your website/page is ranked. So why is this important for your business? You&#8217;ve invested time and capital into your business only to succeed right? However, if users online cannot find your business it&#8217;s basically all a wasted investment of both. The leading search engines are Google, YouTube, Bing, and Yahoo.</p>
<p>Information, information, information &#8211; Google, YouTube, Bing, and Yahoo love this information. The more information you provide makes it easier for search engines to locate and organize it. With increased exposure the higher you rank on Google. Thus increasing the amount of traffic (visitors) which means increasing your profit.</p>
<h2>Trust &amp; Credibility</h2>
<p>SEO builds both trust and credibility into your business because people trust Google, YouTube, Bing, and Yahoo. People use these search engines day in, day out. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Users trust search engines, having a presence in the top positions for the keywords they are searching for, will continuously increase the web site&#8217;s trust.</span></p>
<p>Consider these statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google accounted for more than 73% of desktop searches during 2018</li>
<li>93% of online experiences begin with a search engine</li>
<li>60% of the audience will click on the top three search results</li>
<li>92% of consumers will pick a business from the first page of local search results</li>
</ul>
