								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For over twenty-five years, Greg Stout has been a plastic product designer and for over fourteen years, he has also been a <a href="https://plasticproductdesign.com/">rotational molding designer</a> with his company Blue-Reed LLC. Located in Stow, Ohio, Stout and the experts Blue-Reed have worked to create a company that is innovative, experienced, and allows the client to access a network of molders and designers across North America.</p>
<p>Rotational molding is a plastics process designed to produce hollow plastic parts. Since the molds are relatively inexpensive compared to other plastics processes like injection or blow-molding tooling, this process lends itself to low volume production. A lot of designers chose this way because it is ideal for part quantities of 2,000 or under per year or the production of very large hollow plastic parts. Another reason many designers choose rotational molding is due to the complex geometric shapes, deep draws and zero draft that can be incorporated into each part. No other hollow parts process has the design freedoms and potential of rotational molding. At Blue-Reed, they foster relationships with rotational molders throughout the country and possess an intimate knowledge of their equipment, capabilities and competencies. They would be more than happy to assist you in locating a molder that fits both your geographical and part complexity requirements. Blue-Reed even has relationships with molders as far away as China. If you need a rotational molding designer that can negotiate costs with other manufactures and provide you with molds and designs, then Blue-Reed LLC is the place to go.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://plasticproductdesign.com/directory-rotational-molders">Rotational molding companies</a> can offer wonderful services to your plastic product design in a unique way. Different from the regular plastic molding process, rotational molding requires certain molds for certain results and different tools than regular plastic molding. To find a designer and engineer can be tricky but look no further with Greg Stout and his company, Blue Reed. Stout specializes in rotational molding design and engineering together so you don&#8217;t have to go to two different places. He has had over twenty five years experience in the plastics design and engineering business and his client base and connections have grown immeasurably over the years. He can get clients hooked with manufacturers or tools to complete their designs and he also does consulting.</p>
<p>His knowledge and skill are incredibly valuable in a field that is so narrow. His home base is right in Stow, Ohio but Stout has created a list on his website of rotational molding companies he has come in contact with and worked with over the years. Just a few states with rotational molding companies include California, Indiana, Ohio and Texas. There are many more on the list and he also has international companies on his list as well.</p>
<p>Here at ADVAN Design we have joined together with Stout and Blue Reed to get his website to the top of the search engines. We are working hard to ensure that his business is fairly represented and to get the word out about Blue Reed and other rotational molding companies.</p>
