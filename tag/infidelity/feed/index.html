								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Susan Perry, a retired federal agent, is an infidelity expert and now author, who wants you to recognize the <a href="http://uncoverinfidelity.com">signs of infidelity</a> in your marriage or relationship. She has had personal experience with the issue by being married to a commercial airline pilot for over seven years, not thinking she would ever have to draw upon her investigative experience to uncover an act of betrayal that was so emotionally devastating or that the perpetrator would be someone she loved and trusted.</p>
<p>Susan’s book, &#8220;TEN WAYS to Keep Other Women Away from Your Husband&#8217;s Cockpit&#8221;  is unique in that she offers first-hand experience and advice on the topic of infidelity, as well as two decades of knowledge in covert surveillance techniques, financial analysis, and the art of acquiring hard-to-obtain information. She is the only infidelity expert on the circuit who has the investigative background to provide “how-to” practical advice to women who want to determine if their partner is being unfaithful, but don&#8217;t have the financial resources to find out or do not want to hire a private investigator. With her impressive accomplishments during her time as a federal agent, Susan has investigated everything from income tax evasion to terrorist financing and has traveled the world as an expert in financial investigations, giving presentations at conferences attended by law enforcement and government officials dedicated to the development of national and international policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Along with her signs of infidelity website, Susan has written articles for such magazines as First for Women and has been a guest on radio shows, The Ladies Room, and The Jay Thomas Radio Show as well as others.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered if you spouse or partner could be cheating, take Susan Perry&#8217;s <a href="http://uncoverinfidelity.com">infidelity test</a>. It only takes five minutes and has twenty-four questions. Susan has had first had experience with infidelity when she was married to a commercial airline pilot for more than seven years. She never thought she would have to use her investigation skills as a retired federal agent  to uncover an act of betrayal that was emotionally devastating and caused by someone she loved and trusted dearly.</p>
<p>Susan&#8217;s goal is to help other women uncover the truth in their relationships and wants them to know the signs if they feel something is not right. The infidelity test is designed to assist the recipient in recognizing some of the possible indications of infidelity. It is an abridged version of the questionnaire in Susan&#8217;s book, &#8220;TEN WAYS to Keep Other Women Away from Your Husband&#8217;s Cockpit,&#8221; and as such is not an all-inclusive list of potential warning signs. They are simply some of the more prevalent issues the women, who participated in her research, said they encountered when dealing with an unfaithful spouse or partner. Viewed separately, none of the items are terribly suspect of infidelity, but when combined with other actions or questionable behaviors, it is often a good indicator that something could be amiss. To discover if you are in a low or high-risk category for infidelity and want to participate in the infidelity test,  follow the link in this article and see what your results are.</p>
