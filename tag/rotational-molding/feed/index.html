<div class="person__desc">
<p>Rotomolding design is a specialized field that has a unique set of rules and regulations to ensure that a product can be successfully rotationally molded and achieve all the required specifications. It not only takes experience with the rotational molding process, knowledge of the rotational molding companies who will be manufacturing the product as well as materials, tooling, material flow in addition to a strong plastics engineering background to successfully design rotomolded products. It&#8217;s a narrow field but Greg Stout has all the knowledge and skill that you will ever need in a plastics designer. He fits all the criteria and more with Blue Reed. He has fit all the criteria for over 25 years to be exact. And he will work with you to ensure that the manufacturers give you good prices without skipping out on the quality product that you are looking for. Rotational molding and hollow plastic product design are what Blue Reed specializes in and if you are looking for more information on what Stout and Blue Reed can do for you or if you have any questions as to what rotational molding is or the guidelines, click on the link above or call Blue Reed at 330-322-8707.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rotational molding can be dated back to 1855 as a process used to create a metal product, actually. The Sun Rubber Company is credited for starting it. They were producing rubber balls and hot water bottles before using plastic to create hollow doll heads in 1955. Rotational molding continues to change and grow over the years. Perhaps the greatest advantage of rotational molding is that you are able to incorporate many parts into one. This saves time and cost. The greatest disadvantage is that there are not a lot of resin options to choose from. However, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. Contact Greg Stout and Blue Reed, LLC, to find out what he can do for you today and advise you more on what is rotational molding and to see if it would fit your design best.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Greg Stout is the founder and owner of plastic design company, Blue Reed LLC, in Stow, Ohio and his company also offers <a href="https://plasticproductdesign.com/rotational-molding.html#intro">rotational molding design guidelines</a> to make sure your product is the best it can be. Blue Reed is no stranger to the plastic industry. Here are some tips that they have created over the years in the business to help you better understand what you would like designed by Blue Reed or even if you&#8217;re designing a product yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>When designing your product, keep in mind how the mold will open and close around the product. The least expensive and maintenance mold has two pieces. If your product will require a number of mold pieces, you are increasing the chance of wear and tear due to operator handling and additional parting lines required. A good example is the toy industry, which has mastered the concept of 2-piece mold/product design, resulting in low cost tools used in high production.</li>
<li>Tongue and groove parting lines maintains better registration over the life of the mold.</li>
<li>Avoid parting line on sharp corners or along knife edges, always add a radius.</li>
<li>Avoid vertical parting lines.</li>
<li>Today’s products require multiple piece molds, various types of inserts (stainless, alum., brass), molded threads for caps, internal threads, caster mounting plates are molded in product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blue Reed also has guidelines on shrinking, flatness and stiffening, and radiuses and angles, and many other processes that are involved in the plastic industry. Greg Stout and his team has over 25 years experience in rotational plastic molding so you&#8217;re guaranteed quality service by people who know what they are doing. They can also help you find the right supplier if you&#8217;re in need. Blue Reed will go above and beyond to make sure their customers are satisfied and have a product that they are proud to produce. By following these rotational molding design guidelines, you&#8217;ll be all the better off and you will be glad you contacted Greg Stout and Blue Reed. Don&#8217;t wait! Find out what they can do for you today!</p>

Different from the regular plastic molding process, rotational molding requires certain molds for certain results and different tools than regular plastic molding. To find a designer and engineer can be tricky but look no further with Greg Stout and his company, Blue Reed.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://plasticproductdesign.com/services/rotational-molding-design">Rotational molding design</a> can be a tricky business. Sometimes the results are not what you want them to be and other times, they more than you could ever want them to be. But in the hands of Greg Stout and his freelance company, Blue Reed, rotational molding design doesn&#8217;t have to be tricky. He has over 25 years experience in the plastics design business and has built up connections with plastic manufacturers and tool suppliers to ensure his clients get the best product possible and that their designs are brought to life. His patience, dedication and familiarity with the rotational molding process are valuable in such a tiny field with limited designers and engineers.</p>
<p>What is wonderful about Stout is that not only does he have experience as a designer but as a rotational mold making engineer. He knows the process backwards and forwards. He can see the problems the molding may be having and he can also see what can and can&#8217;t be done to fix them. Whether it&#8217;s cast aluminum, sheet metal or machined molds, Stout can work with multiple tools and materials to give clients a product that is expertly crafted and durable to boot. For Stout, rotational molding design is not only a job but a passion. Knowing what type of molding, what threads and what tools to use are just a few of Stouts many skills.  And not only will Blue Reed create your molded plastic design, they will also consult on a design you created yourself. You can ask any design or engineering question and Stout and his team will be there to answer it. Only someone with experience and immense skill could be able to do that, and that person is Greg Stout.</p>
