								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backyard Drainage System From AllScapes Ohio | Yard Drainage System | Lawn Drainage System | There’s No Scape We Can’t Handle.</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water is key to both growth and life when it comes to a healthy lawn.  However, water can also put a healthy lawn at risk. Water damage can allow both roof leaks and mold to impact your lawn and home, and cost thousands in the long run.  For this reason, Allscapes Ohio’s exclusive backyard drainage system solutions save Northeast Ohio families significant resources and allow them to enjoy their outdoor spaces.  Take a look below at the yard drainage system options from Allscapes Ohio.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downspouts | Lawn Drainage System</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option protects both a basement and a roof.  It’s a great choice for preventing mold, protecting plants, moisture buildup, and corrosion.  However, it is the most high-maintenance option of AllScapes’ lawn drainage system solutions.  </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">French Drains | Yard Drainage System</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A French drain creates a hidden path across a lawn.  The installation moves extra water and prevents pooling.  This option is ideal for properties facing water damage in a basement.   </span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawn Grading | Backyard Drainage System</span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawn grading refers to both the leveling and smoothing of a lawn so rain flows out of a lawn and away from a home’s foundation.  </span></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="content-box-heading" style="text-align: center;" data-inline-fontsize="true" data-inline-lineheight="true" data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="23"> Fencing</h2>
<p>Have you been debating whether to install a fence?  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fences can add many different levels of security. </span>To help narrow down your debate here are some most common reasons to build an enclosure for the yard.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Property Borderline</strong> &#8211; A clear definition of landscape (trees and lawn) to distinguish property lines.</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Privacy</strong> &#8211; Enjoy the privacy of your backyard without worrying about onlookers.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Decorative Appeal</strong> &#8211; Add instant appeal to your home with fencing. </span></li>
<li><strong>Added Security of Children &amp; Pets </strong>&#8211;  K<span style="font-weight: 400;">eeping them restrained and safe, preventing any roaming into the road that could lead to disastrous incidents.</span></li>
<li><strong>Preventing Trespassing</strong> &#8211; Providing an <span style="font-weight: 400;">obstruction to help prevent intruders. As well as added security if you have a swimming pool or trampoline (most insurance companies require a fence in this situation) on your property. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>No matter the reason behind your decision to install a fence, most importantly make sure it&#8217;s sturdy, reliable and installed properly. Call Allscapes today for a free quote on fencing your property.</p>
<h2 class="content-box-heading" style="text-align: center;" data-inline-fontsize="true" data-inline-lineheight="true" data-fontsize="18" data-lineheight="23">Retaining Walls</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the purpose of a retaining wall?  Simply put they consist of a structure typically made from stone, concrete, or timber. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various types of retaining walls, including gravity walls, anchored walls, cantilever walls and more. The basic function of a retaining wall is to battle gravity;  when extra support is essential to prevent the earth from moving downhill with erosion. However, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hese hardscape features of a home are becoming increasingly popular; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retaining walls are versatile, beautiful, and functional. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most common reasons to build a retaining wall: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimize Erosion &#8211;</strong> Slopped areas are commonly affected by heavy downpours of rain, high winds, and melting snowfall results in soil erosion runoff.</li>
<li><strong>Manage Flooding</strong> &#8211; Ohio is actually considered a minor flooding state. However, most Ohioans would beg to differ. Retaining walls will divert flowing water away from your house minimizing the <span style="font-weight: 400;">risk of property damage.</span></li>
<li><strong>Landscaping &amp; Gardening</strong> &#8211; <span style="font-weight: 400;">The walls not only support your slopped lawn, but they can also be used to create a flat area into a stunning floral garden setting with vines or flowers trailing down them. Additionally, this is a great setting for planting a luscious vegetable garden.</span></li>
<li><strong>Curb Appeal</strong> &#8211; Add dimension<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and personality to your yard while increasing your property value.</span> Retaining walls can <span style="font-weight: 400;">be curved, wavy, built-in multiple tiers and made from a variety of sturdy materials. Designed to fit the style of your home and property, tailored to your needs.</span></li>
<li><strong>Landscape Seating</strong> &#8211; Designers creating a comfortable area for <span style="font-weight: 400;">sitting with friends, a beautiful place to sit and chat, or playing games. </span></li>
</ul>
