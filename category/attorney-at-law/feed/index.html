<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiltner Law puts its focus exclusively on criminal defense.  Max Hiltner founded Hiltner Law in 2014 to remedy the lack of criminal defense firms.  Hiltner drew from his law school background of constitutional law and criminal law to develop his professional focus.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law firm maintains a distinct emphasis on the role of trial lawyers.  While some attorneys may strive to avoid going to trial, the dedicated lawyers at Hiltner Law prepare themselves to go to trial at any point.  They realize how much their clients have on the line. Look to Hiltner Law to find a committed federal criminal defense lawyer. Maxwell Hiltner and Nicolette E.
